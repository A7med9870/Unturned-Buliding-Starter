I wanted to make my own blender addon to help with the creation procces of new bulidings
I had a blender file that contained moulder objects that get used for buildngs; sadly i havent been able to pin point who exactly created the file
this addon uses the models he/she made years ago, with little adjustments for 5x5 countiby
The way it works, it looks at a blender file inside the addon difercty, when you try to add a new mesh
it will show a new list of objects you could add to your scene
Walls, Windows, Doors, Stairs, Ramparts
if there is some requests for more objects to be ready for adding to blender, then i will look into it


I don't think it will help veterens with blender much, escpily shurtcuts wizards
but i think it can help new users getting their new buildings modeled quicker with this addon

the credits goes to , and the person behind the models

after reaching out to "" (forget his name atm of writing this note)
he said he got them from someone else
but that else, has not said if he made them or not
